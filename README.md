# ATM-PROJECT
This project is a comprehensive ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system implemented in Java, leveraging JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for database management. The system provides a simulated interface for users to perform basic banking operations such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking balances.

Features:

User Authentication:  Secure login system requiring users to input their account number and PIN.
Account Management:   Users can create new accounts, view account details, and update their personal information.
Transaction Handling: Supports withdrawal, deposit, and transfer operations with real-time balance updates.
Transaction History:  Maintains a detailed transaction history for each account, accessible to users upon login.
Database Integration: Utilizes JDBC to interact with a MySQL database for storing account information and transaction records.
Exception Handling:   Robust error handling to ensure smooth operation even in unexpected scenarios.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive command-line interface for user interaction.


Technologies Used:

Java: Core programming language for implementing the ATM system logic.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): Standard API for connecting Java applications with databases.
MySQL: Relational database management system used for storing account and transaction data.
